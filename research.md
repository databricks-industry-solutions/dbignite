# Research Project: Utilizing Marshmallow and Dataclasses for Patient Data 

## Introduction
Welcome to our research project on utilizing Marshmallow and Dataclasses for analyzing patient data. In this project, we explore how to leverage these libraries for processing patient data efficiently. Marshmallow provides a robust serialization/deserialization framework, while Dataclasses simplify the creation of data objects.

## Project Overview
Our research project focuses on the following key areas:
- Serializing and deserializing patient data using Marshmallow schemas
- Creating data objects with Dataclasses for representing patient information
- Exploring healthcare standards like FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for data representation
- Investigating databases such as DbIgnite for storing and querying patient information

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you need:
- Python installed on your machine
- Marshmallow and dataclasses-json libraries installed (`pip install marshmallow dataclasses-json`)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.
4. Run the provided Python scripts to execute different parts of the research project.

## Project Structure
- `create_patient_objects.py`: Python script for creating patient data objects using Dataclasses and Marshmallow.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample patient data in JSON format.
- `analysis/`: Directory for scripts related to data analysis using Marshmallow and Dataclasses.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including this README.md.

## Sample Code
```python
from marshmallow import Schema, fields
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json

# Define a dataclass representing a Patient
@dataclass_json
class Patient:
    id: str
    name: str

# Define a Marshmallow schema for serializing/deserializing Patient objects
class PatientSchema(Schema):
    id = fields.Str()
    name = fields.Str()

# Example JSON data for a patient
patient_data = {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe"
}

# Deserialize JSON data into a Patient object
patient = PatientSchema().load(patient_data)

# Serialize Patient object into JSON
patient_json = PatientSchema().dumps(patient)

print(patient)
print(patient_json)
